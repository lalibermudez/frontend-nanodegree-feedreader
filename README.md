# Feedreader Testing Project

This is a required project for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. It is based on the JavaScript testing library: [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html). It's purpose is for the students to learn how to use Jasmine by writing a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 

## Getting Started

To start working on the Feedreader app, you may clone, fork or download this repository to your local machine. 

- To load the application, simply open the index.html file on your browser, it is located in the main folder.
- To continue writing further tests, you will need to modify the feedreader.js file, in the jasmine folder: [jasmine/spec/feedreader.js](https://github.com/lalibermudez/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js)
- To add further functionality to the file, you will need to modify the app.js file, in the js folder: [js/app.js](https://github.com/lalibermudez/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/blob/master/js/app.js) 

## Running the Application

To see the application in action, just click [here](https://lalibermudez.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).

### Prerequisites

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) is already included in the application, however might need to review the documentation to be able to continue writing the appropriate tests.
