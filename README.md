# Feedreader Testing Project

This is a required project for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. It is based on the JavaScript testing library: [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html). It's purpose is for the students to learn how to use Jasmine by writing a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 

## Getting Started

If you wish to write a new test, you'll need to modify this file [jasmine/spec/feedreader.js](https://github.com/lalibermudez/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js).

Feel free to clone or download this repo, to continue doing further tests.

### Prerequisites

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) is already included in the application, however might need to review the documentation to be able to write the proper tests. 

## Running the Application
